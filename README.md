# Converge Project Overlay
Project Overlay Mod for the Converge Conference


## Rationale

The GCTools Data Science Team has been experimenting with new ways to let users explore the wealth of information that is available on the GCTools. The [original Project Overlay](https://github.com/gctools-outilsgc/gcconnex-project-overlay) was a result of this experimentation. It combines Natural Language Processing with interactive data visualizations to present a new way of exploring information on the GCTools.

One of the most interesting features of the Project Overlay is the separation of group information into certain categories, and allowing users to explore the linkages between categories.

## Collaboration with Converge Canadian Lab Practicioners

This product is the result of a collaboration with the [Converge Canadian Lab Practicioners Exchange](http://www.radiussfu.com/converge-canadian-lab-practitioners-exchange/) to let the participants of the exchange explore how their ideas are related to other labs across Canada. This version of the Project Overlay uses the [UN Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/) as categories, and places groups according to which sustainable development goals they work toward.


## Differences
* This version of the Project Overlay pulls from GCcollab, not GCconnex
* This version of the Project Overlay does not process any of the text
